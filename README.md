BIGMART SALES ADVERTISING
This project aims to analyze and optimize advertising strategies for BigMart sales using Python libraries. The primary objective is to leverage data-driven insights to enhance sales performance by identifying key factors that influence customer purchasing behavior. By utilizing various data analysis, machine learning, and visualization techniques, this project will help in making informed advertising decisions.

Key Objectives:
Data Collection & Preprocessing:

Utilize historical sales data from BigMart.
Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.
Feature engineering for improving model performance.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizing sales trends and patterns using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Understanding the impact of different advertising strategies on sales.
Correlation analysis between store attributes, customer demographics, and sales.
Predictive Modeling:

Implement regression model (Linear Regression) to predict sales performance.
Compare different machine learning models using scikit-learn.
Optimize model parameters using hyperparameter tuning techniques.
Advertising Optimization Strategies:

Use data-driven insights to recommend advertising budget allocation.
Identify the most effective promotional strategies using customer segmentation analysis.
Utilize clustering techniques like K-Means to segment customers for targeted advertising.
Visualization & Reporting:

Generate interactive dashboards using Plotly and Dash for real-time sales monitoring.
Create data reports with key performance indicators (KPIs) to assist decision-making.
